# CopyOnSelect

Copy on select plugin for [Sublime Text 3][].

This plugin is actually built on top of Chris Panzier's awesome plugin [CopyOnSelect][]

I just added cherries on top of it.

### Settings:
- `delay (ms)`: Delay before selection is copied to clipboard.
- `to_enable (boolean)`: To control whether to activate the plugin or not.

### Commands:
- `Toggle Copy On Select`: To toggle the activation of the plugin. Useful in case where you no longer want the code to be selected on copy.

### Thanks:
Many thanks and credit to [Chris Panzier][] for the plugin.
